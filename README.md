## How To Play the Game
The board starts out with a single blank position, represented by the '*'.  To make a move, select the letter of a peg.  A peg must be able to jump over an adjacent peg into a blank position for a move to be valid.  The jumped peg is then removed from the board. The game is over when there are no valid moves left.
